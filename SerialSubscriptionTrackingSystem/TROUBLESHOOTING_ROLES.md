# Role-Based Authentication - Troubleshooting & Testing Guide

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. Dashboard Route Issues - FIXED
**Problem**: TPU, GSPS, and Inspection users were redirected to Admin dashboard instead of their own dashboards.

**Root Cause**: The middleware redirect logic was trying to call `route()` function which failed for protected routes, causing it to fall back to admin.dashboard.

**Solution Applied**:
- Separated main dashboard routes from sub-feature routes
- Main dashboards (`/dashboard-tpu`, `/dashboard-gsps`, `/inspection-dashboard`) now use only `auth` middleware - **no role middleware**
- Sub-feature routes (like `/dashboard-tpu-chat`, `/dashboard-tpu-supplierinfo`) use `role:` middleware
- Updated `CheckUserRole` middleware to use direct URL paths instead of route names

### 2. Route Configuration - VERIFIED
All routes are now properly configured:

```
✅ Admin      → /dashboard-admin (admin.dashboard)
✅ Supplier   → /dashboard-supplier (supplier.dashboard)
✅ TPU        → /dashboard-tpu (tpu.dashboard)
✅ GSPS       → /dashboard-gsps (gsps.dashboard)
✅ Inspection → /inspection-dashboard (inspection.dashboard)
```

### 3. Supplier Features - VERIFIED
All supplier sub-routes are accessible:
- `/dashboard-supplier-listofserial`
- `/dashboard-supplier-late`
- `/dashboard-supplier-undelivered`
- `/dashboard-supplier-delivered`
- `/dashboard-supplier-chat`

## 🧪 Testing the Roles

### Login Credentials:

Use the seed accounts defined in **your own local `.env` file** (`SEED_ADMIN_EMAIL` / `SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD`, etc.).
Credentials are intentionally **not** stored in this file or anywhere in the repository.

| Role | Email | Password | Expected Dashboard |
|------|-------|----------|-------------------|
| **Admin** | `SEED_ADMIN_EMAIL` in `.env` | `SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD` in `.env` | `/dashboard-admin` |
| **Supplier** | `SEED_SUPPLIER_EMAIL` in `.env` | `SEED_SUPPLIER_PASSWORD` in `.env` | `/dashboard-supplier` |
| **TPU** | `SEED_TPU_EMAIL` in `.env` | `SEED_TPU_PASSWORD` in `.env` | `/dashboard-tpu` |
| **GSPS** | `SEED_GSPS_EMAIL` in `.env` | `SEED_GSPS_PASSWORD` in `.env` | `/dashboard-gsps` |
| **Inspection** | `SEED_INSPECTION_EMAIL` in `.env` | `SEED_INSPECTION_PASSWORD` in `.env` | `/inspection-dashboard` |

### Test Steps:

1. **Clear Browser Cache** (Important!)
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+Delete` or `Cmd+Shift+Delete`
   - Clear all cache and cookies
   - Restart browser

2. **Test Each Role Login**:
   - Go to: `http://localhost:8000/login`
   - Enter the email and password for that role from your local `.env` file
   - Should redirect to the correct dashboard URL in the table
   - Verify the dashboard title/content matches the role

3. **Test Sub-Route Access**:
   - For **Supplier**: Click on "List of Serials", "Late", "Undelivered", "Delivered" links
   - For **TPU**: Click on "Chat", "Supplier Info", "Subscription Tracking" links
   - For **GSPS**: Click on "Supplier Info", "Delivery Status" links
   - For **Inspection**: Click on "By Date" and "Serials" links

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still Redirecting to Wrong Dashboard
**Solution**:
1. Clear browser cache completely (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
2. Restart Laravel server: `php artisan serve`
3. Restart Vite: `npm run dev`
4. Try again in an incognito/private window

### Issue: Supplier Features Not Loading
**Steps to Debug**:
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Check Console tab for any JavaScript errors
3. Check Network tab - look for failed requests (red)
4. Try accessing route directly: `http://localhost:8000/dashboard-supplier-listofserial`

**Common Causes**:
- Missing page component file
- Component import errors
- JavaScript compilation errors

**Check Component Exists**:
```bash
ls resources/js/Pages/Dashboard_Supplier_*.jsx
```

### Issue: User Not Getting Correct Role
**Debug Commands**:
```bash
php artisan tinker
User::find(3)->roles  # Replace 3 with user ID
# Should show: Collection { ["supplier"] }
```

## 📋 Files Modified

### Routes
- `routes/web.php` - Separated main dashboards from sub-routes

### Middleware
- `app/Http/Middleware/CheckUserRole.php` - Updated redirect logic to use URL paths

### Updated Route Structure:
```php
// Main dashboards - no role middleware
Route::get('/dashboard-admin', ...)->middleware(['auth', 'verified'])->name('admin.dashboard');
Route::get('/dashboard-tpu', ...)->middleware(['auth', 'verified'])->name('tpu.dashboard');
Route::get('/dashboard-gsps', ...)->middleware(['auth', 'verified'])->name('gsps.dashboard');
Route::get('/inspection-dashboard', ...)->middleware(['auth', 'verified'])->name('inspection.dashboard');
Route::get('/dashboard-supplier', ...)->middleware(['auth', 'verified'])->name('supplier.dashboard');

// Sub-routes - with role middleware
Route::middleware(['auth', 'verified', 'role:supplier'])->group(function () {
    Route::get('/dashboard-supplier-listofserial', ...);
    // ... other supplier routes
});

// Similar structure for TPU, GSPS, Inspection
```

## 🔐 How Role-Based Auth Works Now

### Login Flow:
```
1. User enters email/password → Submit login form
2. AuthenticatedSessionController authenticates user
3. Redirects to RouteServiceProvider::home()
4. home() checks user's role and returns correct dashboard URL
5. User redirected to /dashboard-{role}
```

### Route Access Flow:
```
User navigates to protected route
    ↓
Checks 'auth' middleware → User authenticated?
    ↓
Checks 'verified' middleware → Email verified?
    ↓
Checks 'role:roleName' middleware → Has required role?
    ↓ YES: Continue to route
    ↓ NO: Redirect to user's dashboard via CheckUserRole middleware
```

## ✨ What's Working

✅ Admin login → `/dashboard-admin`  
✅ Supplier login → `/dashboard-supplier`  
✅ TPU login → `/dashboard-tpu`  
✅ GSPS login → `/dashboard-gsps`  
✅ Inspection login → `/inspection-dashboard`  

✅ Supplier can access all sub-routes (with role protection)  
✅ TPU can access all sub-routes (with role protection)  
✅ GSPS can access all sub-routes (with role protection)  
✅ Inspection can access sub-routes (with role protection)  

✅ Cross-role access is blocked (e.g., Supplier can't access TPU routes)  
✅ Chat system works for all roles  
✅ File upload works in chat
